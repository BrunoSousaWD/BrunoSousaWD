I'm "de Sousa, Bruno de Sousa", I enjoy doing and learning about Front-End projects.
Frameworks like **Bootstrap, Sass, React, Tailwind** are some of the tools that I use to get my projects done.
I'm intrested on build app's that keep up with the corrent **Industry standards** and that are also **user frendly** and **accecible to everyone**. 

Skills: **HTML CSS JS REACT**
